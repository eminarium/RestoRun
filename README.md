Job Description:

I want to build an table ordering system for restaurants and cafes, to take orders directly from every table online. For example, the steps will be as follows:
1. The customer scans a qr code and sees the menu, prices and photos.
2. He chooses in his basket what he wants to buy and sends the order.
3. The store is notified of the order and prepares it.
It doesn't have to be anything special with e-payments and login systems. Simple and fast.
